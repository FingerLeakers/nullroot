# nullroot

When the `root` account is not enabled in macOS High Sierra 10.13.1, it is possible to create a root account with a known password that you can then use for whatever you want. This is a PoC `python3` script for exploiting that vulnerability. Please use only on systems that you own or have permission to test on.

### usage

`python3 NULLROOT.py`
